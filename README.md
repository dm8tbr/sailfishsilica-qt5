sailfishsilica-qt5
==================

This is an upload of Jolla's Silica components as shipped
with their Sailfish operating system and SDK.

It is meant as a point of reference for developers.

sanitization
------------

As the sailfishsilica-qt5 package contains a mix of BSD licensed
and proprietary files it would not be suitable for a 1:1 upload.
Thus all files that are not *clearly* BSD licensed were considered
proprietary and replaced by a symlink to this ReadMe.
All BSD licensed files are unaltered and pristine reproductions
of the files contained in the sailfishsilica-qt5 packages shipped
by Jolla

note
----

This is only a copy, a mirror of sorts, for Jolla's files, as they
don't have a public repository of their own.
Please contact upstream with any issues, suggestions, problems 
or questions.

Pull requests, questions, etc. directed to this repository or its
owner will be *ignored*.
